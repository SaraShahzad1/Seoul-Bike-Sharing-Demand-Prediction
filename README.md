## Abstract
This project, using 2 classical machine learning models **(Ridge Regresion and Random Forest)** and a deep learning **Neural Networks** model, predicts the hourly count of rented bikes in Seoul using temporal and weather related features. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the comparative performance of classical versus deep learning approaches. Statistical tests confirm the significance of differences in model performance.

## Introduction
Bike sharing has become an essential component of urban transportation. Accurate prediction of bike demand can optimize resource allocation and improve service quality. This project aims to predict the number of rented bikes within Seoul; South Korea using a combination of temporal (date, day, month, weekday) and environmental features (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) by applying both classical machine learning and deep learning models.

### Objectives
* Implement and tune classical ML models.
* Design and train deep neural networks.
* Compare model performance using multiple metrics.
* Conduct statistical significance testing for model comparison.
